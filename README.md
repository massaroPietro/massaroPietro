# Hey There! 👋
**I'm Pietro** - I'm a web developer ( I prefer the backend 😏), sometimes mobile developer with Ionic 😆, and Computer Engineering student 💻. I'm interested in development, exciting new projects and meet other developers. I work on random projects in my free time, many of which use the Stripe suite, guess why? 😜
